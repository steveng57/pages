# The Fentanyl Lie

The US Administration has repeatedly lied about a so-called "Fentanyl Crisis" with the drug supposed flowing freely over the US border.

**Spoiler alert**: Now I don't mean to point the finger at Mexico, they have enough challenges, but seriously the crisis is definitely not happening at the Canadian border.

# CA🔁US - How Much Fentanyl Flows from Canada to the U.S.?

Contrary to some recent political claims, the amount of fentanyl flowing from Canada to the United States is **very small**. Here's a breakdown of the facts:

---

## 📉 Fentanyl and the Northern Border

- **Less than 1%** of fentanyl entering the U.S. is linked to Canadian sources.
- Between **2022 and 2024**, only **27 kilograms** of fentanyl were seized at the northern border, compared to over **28,000 kilograms** at the southern border with Mexico.
- In **fiscal year 2025**, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported **33.6 kilograms** seized at the northern border—more than the previous three years combined, but still a tiny fraction compared to Mexico [source](https://www.newsweek.com/fentanyl-trafficking-canada-mexico-border-trump-2040888){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'}.
- Here is a look at fentanyl traffic across US borders, some fancy graphics updated monthly [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-fentanyl-is-seized-at-us-borders/country/united-states/){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'}
- A good, recent [article from NetNewsLedger](https://www.netnewsledger.com/2025/08/05/fact-check-how-much-fentanyl-actually-comes-from-canada-vs-president-trumps-claims/){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'}

## 🌍 Where Does Most Fentanyl Come From?

- **Mexico** is the primary source, producing fentanyl using precursor chemicals from **China**.
- According to the [Congressional Research Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12274){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'}, **98%** of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes via Mexico.

## 🛡️ Canada’s Enforcement Efforts

- Canada has appointed a **Fentanyl Czar** and invested over **$1.3 billion** in border security and drug enforcement.
- Recent operations like **Operation Blizzard** led to thousands of drug seizures, though only a small portion was destined for the U.S.
- Canada has deployed **drones, helicopters, and surveillance towers** to monitor border activity.
- [FINTRAC’s Operational Alert](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/intel/operation/iso-osi-eng.pdf){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'} highlights efforts to disrupt money laundering tied to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.

## ⚠️ Political Context

- The twice impeached, convicted US President cited fentanyl, without evidence, as a reason for imposing **35% tariffs** on Canadian goods, claiming a “massive” flow from Canada.
- Experts and fact-checkers widely dispute this claim, calling it **misleading** and **inconsistent with federal data** [source](https://www.newsweek.com/fentanyl-trafficking-canada-mexico-border-trump-2040888){:target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'}.

> **The Reality**: While Canada is actively fighting fentanyl trafficking, the data shows that the vast majority of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes from Mexico—not Canada.
